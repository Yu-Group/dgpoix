`dgpoix` (pronounced *dee-gee-pwaa*) is an R package which contains a modular library of data generating
processes that are flexible, composable, and easily accommodate real data,
allowing for rapid creation of reality-inspired synthetic data. You can use
`dgpoix` to create synthetic data for simulation experiments which evaluate new
and existing statistical methodologies.
